# A Query Language for your API

---

# Why Should I Care ?

---
export default Layout

# GraphQL APIs have a strongly typed schema

```notes
GraphQL uses Schema Definition Language to define your API and it requires you to set all types.

There is no such thing as an object.

```notes
In this case we are creating a schema that has Speaker and Talk and a speaker can have multiple talks but a talk can only have one speaker and all their fields are typed
```
